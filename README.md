##  Analysis of Hacker News (HN)Â¶

In this project, I'll work with a data set of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News. This is my second guided project on DataQuest, but it is my third in real life.

Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit.

Below are descriptions of the columns:

* id: The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post
* title: The title of the post
* url: The URL that the posts links to, if it the post has a URL
* num_points: The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes
* num_comments: The number of comments that were made on the post
* author: The username of the person who submitted the post
* created_at: The date and time at which the post was submitted
* In this project,I want to determine if certain titles receive more comments on an average and if posts created at a certain time receive more comments on an average
